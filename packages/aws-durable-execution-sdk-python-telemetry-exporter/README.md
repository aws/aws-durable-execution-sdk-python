# AWS Durable Execution SDK for Python — Durable Execution Telemetry plugin

Durable Execution Telemetry instrumentation plugin for the AWS Durable Execution SDK for
Python. A port of the JavaScript SDK's `durableExecutionTelemetry()` plugin: it listens to
the SDK's instrumentation hooks and emits one curated `DurableExecutionTelemetry` record
per execution to the configured exporters. The wire record keeps the JS
camelCase field names so records read identically across SDKs.

## Install

```bash
pip install aws-durable-execution-sdk-python-telemetry-exporter
# with the S3 exporter's local-dev dependency:
pip install "aws-durable-execution-sdk-python-telemetry-exporter[s3]"
```

## Usage

```python
from aws_durable_execution_sdk_python import durable_execution
from aws_durable_execution_sdk_python_telemetry_exporter import (
    DurableExecutionTelemetryConfig,
    durable_execution_telemetry,
)
from aws_durable_execution_sdk_python_telemetry_exporter.exporters import S3Exporter

@durable_execution(
    plugins=[
        durable_execution_telemetry(
            DurableExecutionTelemetryConfig(
                exporters=[
                    S3Exporter(bucket="my-bucket", prefix="durable-execution-telemetry/")
                ],
            )
        )
    ]
)
def handler(event, context):
    ...
```

`durable_execution_telemetry()` returns a plugin *factory*, which is what the SDK's
`plugins` argument takes: the SDK calls its `create_plugin` once per invocation to
build that invocation's plugin instance. The factory holds the resolved
configuration and the exporters, so configuration is per handler while record
state is per invocation. Its type is `DurableExecutionTelemetryPluginFactory`, exported from
the package root for annotating a value you hold.

With no exporter configured, records are written to the function's own
CloudWatch log group as single JSON lines (the `LambdaLogExporter` default),
carrying the name-keyed `operationsByName` summary. The `S3Exporter` writes the
lossless per-occurrence `operations` array, one object per execution
(upsert-by-execution-name, so re-emission overwrites rather than appends).

## Exporters

All exporters live in `aws_durable_execution_sdk_python_telemetry_exporter.exporters` and
are re-exported from the package root. Each serializes the record as compact
JSON. Exporters that call AWS accept an injected `client=` for tests and use
the Lambda runtime's boto3 otherwise; none adds a required dependency.

| Exporter | Destination | Upsert | Operations shape | Default size limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `LambdaLogExporter` | Function's own log group | No | `operationsByName` | 256 KB |
| `CloudWatchLogsExporter` | Any log group, one stream per day | No | `operationsByName` | 256 KB |
| `S3Exporter` | S3 object per execution | Yes (key) | `operations` | 5 MB |
| `DynamoDBExporter` | DynamoDB item | Configurable | `operationsByName` | 400 KB |
| `AuroraExporter` | Aurora MySQL/PostgreSQL row (Data API) | Yes (upsert) | full record as JSON column | 1 MB |
| `RedshiftExporter` | Redshift row (Data API) | Yes (MERGE) | full record as SUPER column | 1 MB |
| `OpenSearchExporter` | OpenSearch document | Yes (`_id`) | `operations` | 10 MB |
| `FirehoseExporter` | Firehose delivery stream | N/A | `operations_format` | 1 MB |
| `EventBridgeExporter` | EventBridge event | N/A | `operations_format` | 256 KB |
| `SQSExporter` | SQS message | N/A | `operations_format` | 256 KB |
| `OTelExporter` | OTLP/HTTP logs endpoint | N/A | `operations_format` | 1 MB |
| `HttpExporter` | Any HTTP endpoint | N/A | `operations_format` | none |
| `FileExporter` | Directory (EFS, mount, `/tmp`) | Configurable | `operations_format` | none |

`operations_format` is `"array"` (default), `"by-name"`, or `"both"`
(`OperationsFormat`). `max_record_size_bytes` raises or lowers an exporter's
size limit; omitting it keeps the default. `HttpExporter` and `FileExporter`
have no default and do not truncate unless a limit is set.

### CloudWatchLogsExporter

Writes one `PutLogEvents` event per record to `log_group_name`, in a stream
named `{log_stream_prefix}{YYYY}/{MM}/{DD}` (default prefix `durable-execution-telemetry/`).
IAM: `logs:CreateLogStream`, `logs:PutLogEvents` on the log group.

```python
CloudWatchLogsExporter(log_group_name="/custom/durable-execution-telemetry")
```

### DynamoDBExporter

`PutItem` keyed by `partition_key` (default `pk`) = `executionArn`. With the
default `sort_key="sk"` (= `emittedAt`) every export adds an item; pass
`sort_key=None` for a key-only table that upserts. IAM: `dynamodb:PutItem`.

```python
DynamoDBExporter(table_name="durable-execution-telemetry")
```

### AuroraExporter

Upserts a row by `execution_arn` through the RDS Data API; `engine` is
`"postgresql"` or `"mysql"` and selects the dialect. Columns: `execution_arn,
execution_name, function_name, status, start_time, end_time, duration_ms,
record_json, emitted_at`. IAM: `rds-data:ExecuteStatement`,
`secretsmanager:GetSecretValue`.

```python
AuroraExporter(
    resource_arn="arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:cluster:my-cluster",
    secret_arn="arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789012:secret:my-db-creds",
    database="telemetry",
    engine="postgresql",
)
```

### RedshiftExporter

`MERGE` by `execution_arn` through the Redshift Data API into
`{schema}.{table}` (default `public.durable_execution_telemetry`, same columns as Aurora,
`record_json` as `SUPER`). Provide `workgroup_name` (Serverless) or
`cluster_identifier` (provisioned, with `db_user` or `secret_arn`). IAM:
`redshift-data:ExecuteStatement` plus `redshift-serverless:GetCredentials` or
`secretsmanager:GetSecretValue`. The statement is submitted and not awaited, so
statement failures are not reported and `on-change` records may land out of
order; prefer the default `on-complete` emit mode with this exporter.

```python
RedshiftExporter(database="telemetry", workgroup_name="telemetry-wg")
```

### OpenSearchExporter

`PUT {endpoint}/{index_name}/_doc/{executionArn}` (default index
`durable-execution-telemetry`). `auth="sigv4"` (default) signs with the runtime's
credentials via botocore; `auth="basic"` uses `username`/`password`. IAM:
`es:ESHttpPut` on the domain.

```python
OpenSearchExporter(endpoint="https://my-domain.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com", region="us-east-1")
```

### FirehoseExporter

`PutRecord` of one JSON line (trailing newline) per record. IAM:
`firehose:PutRecord`.

```python
FirehoseExporter(delivery_stream_name="durable-execution-telemetry-stream")
```

### EventBridgeExporter

`PutEvents` with `Source` (default `software.amazon.lambda.durable.telemetry`),
`DetailType` = record status, `Detail` = record. All arguments optional. IAM:
`events:PutEvents`.

```python
EventBridgeExporter(event_bus_name="default")
```

### SQSExporter

`SendMessage` with the record as body and `status`/`functionName` message
attributes. A `.fifo` queue URL enables `MessageGroupId` (default
`executionArn`, or `message_group_id`) and a deduplication id of
`executionArn:emittedAt`. IAM: `sqs:SendMessage`.

```python
SQSExporter(queue_url="https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/telemetry")
```

### OTelExporter

POSTs one OTLP `ExportLogsServiceRequest` (`http/json` only) per record to
`endpoint`; identity fields become attributes and the record is the log body.
Pass vendor auth in `headers`. No IAM.

```python
OTelExporter(endpoint="https://otlp.vendor.com/v1/logs", headers={"x-api-key": "..."})
```

### HttpExporter

`POST` (or `method="PUT"`) the record as JSON to `url` with
`Content-Type: application/json` plus `headers`; a non-2xx status raises.
`timeout_ms` defaults to 10000 and currently applies to each socket operation
(the connect, each write of the request, and each read of the status line,
headers, and a non-2xx error body; a 2xx body is never read) rather than to the
whole request, so an endpoint that consumes or responds slowly can hold the
export open longer than `timeout_ms`; a future release may enforce it as a
whole-request deadline. No IAM.

```python
HttpExporter(url="https://hooks.example.com/telemetry", headers={"Authorization": "Bearer ..."})
```

### FileExporter

`mode="ndjson"` (default) appends to `{directory}/{YYYY-MM-DD}.ndjson`;
`mode="json"` writes `{directory}/{executionName}.json`, overwriting on update.
For Lambda use an EFS mount (IAM: `elasticfilesystem:ClientMount`,
`elasticfilesystem:ClientWrite`) or `/tmp` for testing. Appends from many
concurrent environments to one NDJSON file on a network file system can
interleave; use `mode="json"` when several environments share a directory.

```python
FileExporter(directory="/mnt/efs/durable-execution-telemetry")
```

Emission behavior, record schema (`recordType: DurableExecutionTelemetry`,
`schemaVersion: "1.0"`), sampling, content configuration (input/output
omission, `include_errors`, per-operation result opt-in), truncation phases,
and `top-level` vs `full-tree` operation detail all mirror the JS plugin.
Behavior is validated cross-SDK by the `telemetry` conformance suite
(`aws-durable-execution-conformance-tests-telemetry`).

> **Note (asynchronous export).** Export rendering, truncation, `export()`, and
> `flush()` run on one lazy background worker per registered factory. Checkpoint
> hooks only replace the latest pending snapshot and wake the worker. Consecutive
> `on-change` snapshots may coalesce while an export is in flight. Every
> sampled-in invocation end waits for a covering flush to complete after its
> drain starts, including an end that emitted no record. Overlapping ends may
> share a flush when it covers both entry snapshots. Only a sampled-out execution
> neither exports nor flushes. Exporter failures are logged and isolated; this is
> best-effort telemetry, not a guarantee of delivery to the destination.

> **Note (invocation-end latency under concurrency).** The drain an invocation
> end performs captures a finite snapshot of work already scheduled across the
> factory's executions. It waits until those records have been offered to the
> exporters and a covering flush completes. If a pending record is coalesced, its
> replacement satisfies the earlier obligation. Once the worker takes that
> replacement, later records for the same execution belong to a new queue slot.
> Later drains cannot extend an earlier flush target: they share a covering
> target or queue a subsequent one. Thus continuing arrivals do not move an
> earlier drain's finish line. One worker serializes exports and flushes, so
> invocation-end latency still includes other executions' work present at entry
> and any earlier flushes. Budget for that finite backlog, especially when an
> exporter makes a network call per record.

## Requirements

- `aws-durable-execution-sdk-python` with the plugin invocation hooks that
  surface `execution_input` / `execution_result` (included since the version
  this package declares as its minimum).
